# Objective:

Repository for code templates to tackle Data Structures and Algorithm problems in `typescript` and `javascript`.

# Steps to add files:

1. Add `.ts` file in `./typescript/` folder.
2. Run `tsc` at project root. This would auto-generate corresponding `.js` file.

# Note:

1. The project doesn't have the setup needed to run the `.ts` or `.js` files against test cases.
